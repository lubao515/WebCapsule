# WebCapsule
WebCapsule is a Record & Replay engine for Web Browsers implemented as a self-contained instrumentation of Blink/V8. WebCapsule allows for recording and replaying browsing traces, and primarily aims to enable the reconstruction and forensic analysis of web security incidents such as social engineering and phishing attacks.
